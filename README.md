## 1. Creational: 
These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns.
    
- Singleton
  - Eager
  - Lazy
  - Thread safe
- Factory
- Builder (_"construct a complex object from simple objects using step-by-step approach"_)

## 2. Structural: 
These patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition. The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition.

- Decorator (aka Wrapper)
- Adapter (aka Wrapper)

## 3. Behavioral: 
These patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others.

- Command (aka Action, Transaction)
- Observer (aka Dependents, Publish-Subscribe)
- Strategy (aka Policy)
