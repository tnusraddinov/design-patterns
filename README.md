# design-patterns

## 1. Creational: 
These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns.
    
- Singleton
  - Eager
  - Lazy
  - Thread safe


## 2. Structural: 
These patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition. The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition.

## 3. Behavioral: 
These patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others.
